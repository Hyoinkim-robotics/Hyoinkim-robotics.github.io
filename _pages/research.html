<p> In Spring 2014, I joined <a href="http://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR</a> (former ICSL) in Seoul National University to pursue research in <b>Robotics</b>. From Winter 2020, I has been working at Mechatronics Research, Samsung Electronics.</p>
<p> My research interests in robotics are <b>Learning from Demonstration </b>, [<a href="/research/journal/Learning-and-Generalizing-Cooperative-Manipulation-Skills-using-Parametric-Dynamic-Movement-Primitives/">1</a>, <a href="/research/conference/Motion-Planning-with-Movement-Primitives-for-Cooperative-Aerial-Transportation-in-Obstacle-Environment/">2</a>] and <b>Motion Planning</b> [<a href="/research/conference/Sampling-based-Motion-Planning-for-Aerial-Pick-and-Place/">3</a>].</p>

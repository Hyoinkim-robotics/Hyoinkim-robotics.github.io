**Abstract:** This paper focuses on the optimal motion planning problem for cooperative aerial manipulation. We use the rapidly exploring random trees star (RRT*) algorithm that finds feasible paths quickly and optimizes them. For local planning within RRT*, we developed a trajectory planner using Bezier-curve which utilizes the differential flatness property of the aerial manipulator. Time-parameterization is performed to represent the curve as a function of time.
